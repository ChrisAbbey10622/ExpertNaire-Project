  Expertnaire Refund Policy
  <br>
  <br>
  As a buyer, your purchases are 'backed' by Expertnaire 30-Day money back guarantee, also known as a refund guarantee.
   <br>
   <br>
  If, for any reason, you are not completely satisfied with a purchase.
   <br>
   <br>
  We invite you to review our policy on refunds and returns.
   <br>
   <br>
  This refund policy only covers digital products (not events) and as a result, after a purchase is made, such digital
  products are deemed “used” after download or opening.
   <br>
   <br>
   <b>

    However, Expertnaire offers you a 30-day money-back guarantee if certain necessary conditions are met.
   </b>
   <br>
   <br>
  Again, please note that this refund guarantee accommodates only digital products. It does not cover events.
 </p>
