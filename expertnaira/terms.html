      Question: What is Expertnaire all about?</h3>
    </b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="b" ><b> Re: </b> Expertnaire is an online marketplace for the sale of high value digital products. On Expertnaire, there are 3
    parties - The vendor, the affiliate and the customer
    <br>
    <br>
    The vendor refers to the person who owns the product that is been sold
    <br>
    <br>
    Affiliates are marketers who recommend the products on the platform to people and when any of the person they refer
    buys, they get a commission
    <br>
    <br>
    Customers are simply those who purchase the products been sold on Expertnaire
