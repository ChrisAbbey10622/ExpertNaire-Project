  <br>
  <br>

  (in some cases), you must be accepted by the vendor before you can promote the product or earn any commission from your

  <br>
  <br>
  <b>

   3. Vendors: Selling your products
  </b>
  <br>
  <br>
  Content: As a vendor hereunder, you may submit one or more products for sale (“products”) via the Expertnaire
  marketplace. The products may include any form of digital content (written, audio, video, etc.) (“Content”) as is
  appropriate for your products. All digital products and content must be suitable for digital delivery.
  <br>
  <br>
  Expertnaire acts as a reseller for the vendors' products. That means that buyers are technically buying from Expertnaire
  and not directly from the vendor. You will however retain all rights and liabilities to your products except as provided
  herein.
  <br>
  <br>
  You understand that Expertnaire will review your products or content for completeness, accuracy, quality, marketability,
  or the like, so it's your responsibility as a vendor to submit products with complete, accurate and quality contents
  that match truthfully what's advertised in your sales page, or else Expertnaire might remove them from the marketplace.
  Expertnaire reserves the right to reject any product(s) for any reason or no reason at any time in its sole discretion.
  Moreover, it is to your great advantage to ensure the quality of your product(s). Each product will be subject to
  reviews and/or ratings from purchasers, which will be available and/or prominently displayed to potential buyers of your
  product(s) in the market place.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>

   (i) Allowed product(s):
  </b>
  <br>
  <br>
  Expertnaire does not allow, and you agree not to, submit any product(s) or content that are pornographic or offensive in
  nature, or which pertain to pyramid schemes, multi-level marketing (mlm) or any illegal activity, or which contains any
  illegal material including but not limited to material that violates another’s copyrights or trademarks, trade dress,
  trade secrets, right of publicity, privacy or other rights, including moral rights or rights of attribution. Expertnaire
  shall use its unfettered discretion and expressly reserves the right to remove any such products, content or material
  from the marketplace, without notice and without compensation to you. You agree that any advertising or other fees paid
  in connection with products, content, or other material that is removed from the marketplace will not be refunded. You
  further agree that you remain fully responsible for any damages to Expertnaire and to its customers that result from
  your submission to, or inclusion of such products, content, or material in the marketplace.
  <br>
  <br>
  To be included in the Expertnaire marketplace, your products must be original. Private label rights (“plr”) that you
  have obtained cannot be the basis of a product. Plr material can be offered, for example, as a free bonus distributed
  alongside a product, but not as the product itself. Expertnaire reserves the right to refuse to accept any product or to
  remove any product that it deems to lack sufficient originality. You must have all required rights, including copyrights
  to all content in your product(s) to allow Expertnaire to sell the product. The foregoing requirement includes all
  content within the product(s), for example cover images, as well as any music, including background music in recorded
  audio or video products. In addition to the other licenses granted herein, you also grant Expertnaire a limited license
  to resell your products, and process all payments in connection therewith. Expertnaire shall pay you in accordance with
  the payment provisions herein. Where you fail to ensure compliance with any of the above the failure of Expertnaire to
  request at the time of submission shall not limit your liability in anyway.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>

   (ii) Pricing of Product(s):
  </b>
  <br>
  <br>
  Vendors and only vendors may set the price (“sales price”) of their own products within the limits established by
  Expertnaire for minimum and/or maximum prices (“price limits”). As a vendor, you agree not to attempt to price any
  product submitted to the marketplace outside of then current price limits in place at the time of submitting the product
  to the Expertnaire marketplace. Expertnaire will post its current price limits prominently on the site. Currently, the
  "lower price limit" is N5000 and the “upper price limit” is N800,000 for any product offered for sale in the
  marketplace. However, Expertnaire expressly reserves the right to set the "upper price limit” for the marketplace as a
  whole, or on a per vendor basis. Vendors with marketplace track records of greater merit (including, e.g., lower refund
  rates, better purchaser reviews, higher ratings, longevity, etc.) may be afforded greater latitude in pricing their
  products, at Expertnaire’s discretion. You understand that as a vendor, you are subject to the foregoing price limits
  unless you have been expressly notified in writing from Expertnaire. Expertnaire will review each petition for a price
  limit raise on a case by case basis, and may accept or decline the petition in its sole discretion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Notwithstanding the foregoing price limits, Expertnaire also reserves the right to raise the upper price limit on a per
  product basis (i.e. for a particular product from a specific vendor) based on Expertnaire’s direct review (“price
  review”) which may include consideration of the vendor’s history in the marketplace, reputation in the industry, the
  product itself, the proposed price, market conditions, current terms and relationships with payment processors,
  gateways, and such other factors as Expertnaire chooses. After such price review, Expertnaire’s decision as to whether
  to raise the upper price limit in any instance shall be final and made in its sole discretion. If Expertnaire chooses
  not to raise the price limit for a given product, vendor agrees that the product shall be offered in the marketplace at
  a sales price below the upper price limit. Expertnaire may charge a “review request fee” or may allow each vendor to
  request a set number of such price reviews at no cost, and may charge a review request fee for any additional price
  reviews requested by that vendor.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a vendor, you understand and agree not to offer the same product listed on the Expertnaire marketplace for a
  different price somewhere else. This includes your website. In situations where the vendor has to alter the price of a
  particular product listed on the Expertnaire marketplace on the vendor's website, the vendor must inform Expertnaire to
  update the price on the Expertnaire website as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Expertnaire reserves the right to suspend a Vendor's product if there are differences in price listed on the Vendor's
  website versus what is listed on Expertnaire
  <br>
  <br>
  Expertnaire may terminate any vendor who violates this provision repeatedly and the vendor shall be solely responsible
  for any liability that may result from such.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  The products must be original and the vendor must hold all required copyrights of the product(s) and content to allow
  Expertnaire to sell the product(s). The product(s) must not relate to any of our forbidden niches (pornography,
  gambling, pyramid schemes, etc).
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  Further Expertnaire shall not be liable for any claims, damages arising out of any negligence, misconduct or

  merely a facilitator for sale of the Vendor’s Product, hence Expertnaire is not responsible/ liable for the Product, its

   4. Affiliates: Promoting products for a commission
  </b>
  <br>
  <br>
  As an affiliate in the Expertnaire marketplace, you will have the opportunity to promote and make commissions on a wide
  variety of digital products offered via the state of the art Expertnaire marketplace. As described above, products
  offered through the Expertnaire marketplace are provided by our vendors for sale by Expertnaire.
  <br>
  <br>
  You evaluate and choose which product(s) to promote:
  <br>
  <br>
  As an affiliate, you are solely responsible for evaluating and selecting the vendors and product(s) you would like to
  market or advertise. Expertnaire endeavors to maintain the highest quality in the marketplace through its unique review
  system. Unlike other marketplaces where products are not reviewed and left to guess work.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, you should understand and agree that Expertnaire is not responsible for the contents, accuracy, quality,
  usefulness, or any other aspects of any product, or any supplementary products.
  <br>
  <br>
  You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for any costs associated with marketing, advertising, or
  mailing, including any marketing materials you choose to develop, regardless of whether your marketing or advertising
  efforts results in sales or not. Moreover, Expertnaire does not provide any legal advice or review of your
  advertisements and you are solely responsible for the content of your marketing and advertising efforts and any
  liability resulting therefrom.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>

   Use only respectful promotion practices:
  </b>
  <br>
  <br>
  You agree that you will not use any marketing or advertising materials which contain any illegal material including but
  not limited to material that violates another’s copyrights or trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets, right of
  publicity, privacy or other rights, including moral rights or rights of attribution, or which are defamatory.
<br>
<br>
  Moreover, you agree that your advertisements and/or promotions will accurately represent the product(s), without hyping
  or exaggerating the contents, benefits or features. You must represent the product(s) in a truthful manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  You further agree that, in connection with products in the Expertnaire marketplace, you will not use any marketing or
  advertising methods that include illegal methods including unsolicited email or sms, false or misleading advertisements
  or any advertisement which makes any claim that is not permitted about earnings or other aspects of a product, or other
  violates any law or regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  You understand and agree that your marketing and advertising efforts shall not state or suggest that you are in fact
  Expertnaire, or representing Expertnaire or endorsed by Expertnaire in any way or that you are the owner of the product
  as this will be treated as impersonation. Your marketing and advertising will not contain or utilize the Expertnaire
  content (as defined herein) except as expressly permitted.
  <br>
  <br>
  You understand and agree that you will not personalize the vendor of the product you are promoting in any way through
  your marketing and advertising or suggest that you are the vendor. If you are found to mislead people by using the
  name(s) of the vendor as your own, it may result in Expertnaire terminating your affiliate account and seizing any
  commissions you have in your affiliate balance without any warning whatsoever.
  <br>
  <br>
  Expertnaire does not allow and you agree not to promote, market, or advertise any products or utilizing advertisements
  that are pornographic in nature, pyramid schemes, multi-level marketing (mlm)). You may not combine your advertising for
  products on the Expertnaire marketplace with advertising for any such non-permitted products (including products not on
  the Expertnaire marketplace).
  <br>
  <br>
  
  You agree not to state, or imply any guarantee or warranty about the product or a refund period other than what is
  expressly provided through the Expertnaire marketplace. Marketing or advertising that provides, states, or implies any
  additional guarantee or warranty is expressly prohibited. Expertnaire may terminate any affiliate who violates this
  provision and the affiliate shall be solely responsible for any liability that may result from such representation.
  <br>
  <br>
  You understand that Expertnaire will use commercially reasonable efforts to track purchases so as to accurately account
  for affiliate commissions. Tracking codes, cookies, and/or similar technological means will be used where appropriate.
  When a potential purchaser views and/or responds to your advertisement, which includes your Expertnaire affiliate
  information, any resulting sale will be credited to your account. Expertnaire does not permit and you agree not to use
  any click jacking, cookie stuffing or other technological means of altering a Expertnaire visitor’s cookies in any way
  to obtain commissions or credit for sales for which you would otherwise not be entitled. Expertnaire reserves the right
  to determine who receives an affiliate commission for any particular sale. Expertnaire also reserves the right to
  terminate, without notice, any affiliate who in Expertnaire’ sole determination, has unacceptably manipulated the
  tracking of purchases or commissions.
  <br>
  <br>
  So, basically vendors (and Expertnaire) can block affiliates with a large history of refunded transaction, low quality
  traffic, etc. moreover, you may have to apply in advance as an affiliate for some of the products you want to promote on
  Expertnaire.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's your responsibility to select the right products to promote from our marketplace. Expertnaire will do its best to
  ensure that the products on our platform are top notch but we do not offer any guarantee or representation in that
  regard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Use only respectful promotion practices (no spamming, no cookie stuffing, etc.), and don't exaggerate or hype the
  product beyond its truthful characteristics.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>

   5. Amount of commission to be paid on product sales
  </b>
  <br>
  <br>
  In exchange for their efforts in marketing and advertising products available in the Expertnaire marketplace, affiliates
  will earn a commission determined as a percentage of the sales price of any product (“affiliate commission”) for sales
  resulting from those marketing and advertising efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  A vendor can set the affiliate commission for any product(s) from 25% to 95%. Proceeds of the sales for each product
  shall be paid as follows: Expertnaire fees shall be deducted from the gross sales price, and the affiliate commission
  shall also be based on the gross sales price as well. Any remaining balance after the Expertnaire fees and affiliate
  commission are paid will be paid to the product vendor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Expertnaire uses a secure tracking system to determine which affiliate referred the sale, and is entitled to a
  commission.
<br>
<br>
  
  So, basically affiliates are paid a commission for their promotion efforts. The vendor of the product determines the
  commission structure for that product.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proceeds that remain after paying the affiliate commissions and Expertnaire fees are paid to the vendor.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  Expertnaire uses a smart tracking system to track affiliate commissions.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>

   6. Secure vendor/affiliate access and communication
  </b>
  <br>
  <br>
  Upon registration as a vendor or affiliate, you will receive an Expertnaire id and password to login as an Expertnaire
  vendor/affiliate, from which you can access the vendor/affiliate resources (e.g. the ability to enter a new product, get
  affiliate links, check sales and other history). Except as otherwise agreed or permitted by Expertnaire in writing, you
  may not share or transfer your id and secure password or access to the Expertnaire system in any way or with any one.
  You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Expertnaire id and password and for any activity
  in connection with your account.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is also your responsibility to keep your phone number and primary email address up to date so that Expertnaire can
  communicate with you via emails, phone calls and sms. You understand and agree that if Expertnaire sends you an
  electronic communication but you do not receive it because your primary email address on file is incorrect, out of date,
  full, or your email is directed to a trash or spam filter, or you are otherwise unable to receive email or messages, the
  electronic communication will be deemed to have been provided to you.
  <br>
  <br>
  You can update your primary email address or other contact information at any time by logging into your Expertnaire
  vendor dashboard. If your email address becomes invalid such that emails sent to you from Expertnaire are returned, we
  may deem your account to be inactive and your status as a vendor/affiliate may be suspended or placed on hold until we
  receive a valid, working primary email address from you.
  <br>
  <br>
  So, basically your login access is individual and private, and it's your responsibility to keep it that way. You may
  receive email or sms notifications from Expertnaire.
<br>
<br>
  <b>

   7. Sales pages and promotional material.
  </b>
  
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>

   Contents of sales pages:
  </b>
 <br>
 <br>
  
  The vendor is responsible for the content of the product sales page (“sales page”). You, the vendor, agree to provide
  all content to Expertnaire in the permitted or required format(s) as determined by Expertnaire and/or to upload such
  content in the permitted or required format(s) in your vendor dashboard. As a vendor, you have no direct access or
  rights to alter any sales page.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>

   Hosting:
  </b>
  <br>
  <br>
  You understand and agree that the sales page ("sales page”) promoting the content and/or products on the marketplace
  will be hosted by Expertnaire on Expertnaire’s servers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Expertnaire will make the sales pages in the marketplace available on the internet, and shall use commercially
  reasonable efforts to maintain the availability (i.e. uptime) of such sales pages for the consuming public. However, no
  guarantees of uptime are made. Expertnaire does not own or control the internet and shall have no responsibility or
  liability for any time(s) the marketplace or specific sale pages are not accessible (i.e. “downtime”), even if your
  marketing and/or advertising efforts, product sales, or commissions are disrupted as a result of such downtime, and even
  if the downtime is a result of Expertnaire’s error or negligence.

   Claims on sales pages or promotions:
  </b>
  
  Whether you are acting as a vendor or affiliate for a product, Expertnaire strictly prohibits any false or misleading
  claims in product(s), sales pages, or in advertisements including your sales copy or other marketing or advertising
  materials related to product(s) on the Expertnaire marketplace, including any affiliate advertising materials.
  <br>
  <br>
  You may not and you agree not to:
  <br>
  <br>
  Make any unsupported, misleading, or false claim about any content or product, or results that it can produce.
  <br>
  <br>
  Include any false or misleading testimonial, endorsement, or implied endorsement. As a vendor, fail to disclose material
  connections between your endorsers of your product; or as an affiliate, fail to disclose material connections between
  any endorser of a product you are promoting and the product provider. You must also disclose if any reviewer or endorser
  of your product was compensated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fail to include any disclaimer or statement(s) needed to qualify your claims, or to keep your advertising from being
  false or misleading. Make any suggestions or unsupported claims as to amounts of income or earnings that are typical or,
  that a purchaser will likely make, or should expect.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  8. Signup fees, pay-outs and refunds, and product refund policy:
  <br>
  <br>
  As a vendor, you agree that once placed in the Expertnaire marketplace, sales of your product will be subject to a
  30-day money-back guarantee from Expertnaire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Consistent with Expertnaire’s guarantee, purchasers are entitled to a 30-day refund period or depending on the product
  vendor's desired configuration for that particular product.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buyers, affiliates and vendors with a high refund history may be banned from purchasing, selling or promoting products
  again from the marketplace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Expertnaire may occasionally and at its sole discretion decide to grant a refund beyond the product money-back guarantee
  period.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>

   Payment processing and signup fees:
  </b>
  <br>
  <br>
  To facilitate the marketplace, Expertnaire will connect with other third part companies (including banks) to process all
  payments for all product purchases made through the Expertnaire marketplace. Thus, you expressly grant permission to
  Expertnaire to sell your products, and to process payments received from the sale of your product(s) in the marketplace,
  and agree to pay the assigned transaction or processing fees (“Expertnaire fees”) in exchange for the services provided
  by Expertnaire, currently, the Expertnaire fees are as follows:
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>

   For affiliates:
  </b>
  <br>
  <br>
  All affiliates are required to register on Expertnaire with N10,000. This sum of N10,000 is a yearly, non-refundable fee
  for affiliate maintenance paid to Expertnaire. Expertnaire has the rights to debit each affiliate of this sum once in a
  year.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>

   For vendors:
  </b>
  <br>
  <br>
  All vendors are required to register on Expertnaire with N25,000 to start selling their products. This is a yearly,
  non-refundable fee. Expertnaire has the rights to debit each vendor of this sum once in a year, plus Expertnaire will
  also charge a commission of 10% per sale on all vendor products, these Expertnaire fees can be changed at any time, and
  vendors and affiliates will be notified.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>

   Payments to vendors/affiliates:
  </b>
  <br>
  <br>
  Except as provided below for first affiliate sale reserve, high-volume sales, or fraud investigation reserve, affiliates
  will be paid their commissions once in a week and vendors will be paid twice a month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, affiliates and vendors can receive payments via any Nigerian bank account, and Expertnaire is constantly
  working to offer new payment methods. Affiliates must have a minimum of N5000 in their Expertnaire balance to qualify
  for a weekly payment.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <b>

   Affiliate first-sale exception:
  </b>
  <br>
  <br>
  Affiliates will not receive commission from their very first sale for each product they promote. this is to prevent the
  incentive for affiliate ‘fraud’ where an affiliate plays the system by granting themselves an instant discount (in the
  form of their affiliate commission) by purchasing a product through their own affiliate link. Expertnaire wants
  professional affiliates who provide a legitimate service to the vendors, and their own customers, in addition to
  Expertnaire. From the second sale onwards, affiliate commissions will be registered as usual. If you believe that, as an
  affiliate, you will only generate one sale per product promoted, you must not sign up as an affiliate.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, in the event of any unusual activity, a transaction volume spike or any specific transaction triggering our
  security filters, Expertnaire reserves the right to hold credits beyond the standard 10-day period subject to
  Expertnaire’s manual investigation of the account's recent activity. This generally will only take a few days, however
  Expertnaire reserves the right to reasonably extend the reserve period for a time sufficient to resolve its questions
  about unusual activity to its own satisfaction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Expertnaire endeavours to keep its reserves/holdback of processed payments as low as possible, and to generally release
  funds to vendors/affiliates within 10 days from the sale.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, in the event of any unusual activity, a transaction volume spike or any specific transaction triggering our
  security filters, Expertnaire reserves the right to hold the credits beyond the standard 10-day period until a system
  administrator manually investigates the account's recent activity. This usually shouldn't take more than a few days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fraud investigation reserve period:
  <br>
  <br>
  If Expertnaire or one of Expertnaire’s payment processors becomes aware of actual fraud, or suspected fraud in
  connection with any purchase or group of purchases related to your account, Expertnaire reserves the right to require a
  fraud investigation. If such an investigation is required, any and all earnings/commissions earned on any basis may be
  temporarily held pending the investigation, whether or not connected to the actual or suspected fraud. Expertnaire will
  use commercially reasonable efforts to have the fewest potential earnings/commissions held, based on its review of its
  risk. Such fraud may be in connection with debit cards, traffic, tracking, or some other basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  If a fraud investigation is initiated, the vendor/affiliate may be asked to provide additional information. You agree to
  cooperate with any such fraud investigation in a reasonable manner. You will be informed of the results of the
  investigation, and a full accounting will be provided regarding your account and any earnings/commissions due.
  <br>
  <br>
  Any vendor/affiliate that has actual or suspected fraudulent activity associated with one or more otherwise creditable
  or commission-earning sales should not assume that Expertnaire suspects them of fraud. Stolen debit cards, fake debit
  cards, and other scams are prevalent on the internet and such activity may have nothing to do with the vendor/affiliate.
  Nonetheless, you understand and agree that you cannot be paid for an otherwise creditable or commission-earning sale,
  where Expertnaire will not be paid. Moreover, Expertnaire will comply with all legal requirements and will report all
  such activities to appropriate authorities. If a vendor/affiliate is believed to be directly or indirectly involved with
  fraudulent activity or attempted fraudulent activity in connection with the Expertnaire marketplace, Expertnaire will
  pursue all available legal action against the vendor/affiliate. In such circumstances, you agree that you will forfeit
  any balance in your account, and that Expertnaire may use any such funds to partially or fully defray its costs of its
  investigation and any subsequent action, including legal fees and costs.
<br>
<br>
  Affiliates signup and maintenance fee: N10,000/year
<br>
<br>
  Vendors signup and maintenance fee: N25,000/year
  <br>
  <br>
  Plus Expertnaire will charge a commission of 10% per sale on all vendor products.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  Funds generated from vendor/affiliate will be released about 3 days after the refund period has expired. So, once those
  funds are indeed released, you will be paid.
  <br>
  <br>
  If there's any unusual activity detected on your account, or if our security filters are triggered, the reserve period
  may be increased while an administrator reviews the account's recent activity.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>

   9. Relationship with Expertnaire:
  </b>
  <br>

  relationship is created between you and Expertnaire. Neither you nor Expertnaire is a partner, a joint venturer, an

  Expertnaire marketplace, content, or services provided to you as a vendor/affiliate in any unvendorized way, including

  <br>
  <br>
  So, basically Expertnaire owns all of its copyrights and trademarks, so don't use (or abuse!) our brand or our
  technology without our written consent.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>

   11. Confidentiality and nondisclosure:
  </b>
  <br>

  You agree that any details or information about Expertnaire, the Expertnaire marketplace, or the services disclosed by
